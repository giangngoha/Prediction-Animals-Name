Data: A sample vocabulary list (word_list) contains short words (3 letters) to simplify the task. In practice, you can use a larger vocabulary file (such as a crossword dictionary).

Model: An LSTM model learns to predict the next character based on the previous characters in a sequence. This simulates guessing a word in a crossword puzzle based on hints and known letters.

Prediction: Given an input like "ca", the model predicts the next character (e.g., "t" to complete the word "cat").

Prediction: Given an input like "do", the model predicts the next character (e.g., "g" to complete the word "dog").

Real-world application: This model can be extended to predict entire words by repeatedly generating the next character or by using crossword clues as additional input.
